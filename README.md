# Votuna

Votuna is an open source collaborative playlist voting app.

It currently supports Spotify and SoundCloud playlist workflows end-to-end (auth, playlist enablement, suggestions, voting, and profile management) with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend.

## Current Feature Status

### Implemented
- Spotify and SoundCloud OAuth login with cookie-based sessions
- Dashboard to:
  - List provider playlists
  - Create a new provider playlist (public/private)
  - Enable existing provider playlists for Votuna
- Playlist detail experience:
  - Search provider tracks from within the playlist page
  - Suggest tracks from search results or by pasting a track URL
  - Vote on suggestions with voter display names in tooltip
  - Play tracks in a persistent "Now Playing" dock
  - Configure playlist vote settings (required vote percent, auto-add toggle)
  - View collaborator roles and suggestion counts
  - Manage tab (owner-only):
    - Import another playlist into the current playlist
    - Export the current playlist into an existing playlist or a newly created playlist
    - Filter transfers by `all`, `genre`, `artist`, or selected `songs`
    - Preview transfer results before execute (matched, to-add, duplicates)
    - Execute with duplicate skip behavior and failure summary
    - Source-track picker with search and pagination for song selection
- Profile page:
  - Edit display name, first name, last name, and email
  - Upload avatar
  - Save theme and email preference settings
- API docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`

### Planned / In Progress
- More music providers:
  - Apple Music login and playlist import
  - TIDAL login and playlist import
  - Cross-provider playlist links and metadata sync
- Playlist management tools:
  - Bulk remove selected tracks from a playlist
  - Duplicate cleanup utility inside a playlist
  - Reorder tools (manual drag/drop + auto-sort presets)
  - Operation history, undo checkpoints, and replay options
- Collaboration and automation:
  - Role-based moderation actions for collaborators
  - Duplicate detection and quality rules
  - Playlist activity feed and vote history export
  - Webhook events for bots and external workflows

## Tech Stack

- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React 18, TanStack Query, Tailwind, Tremor UI
- Dev infra: Docker Compose

## Repository Layout

```text
votuna/
  api/                FastAPI app, models, migrations, tests
  frontend/           Next.js app
  docker-compose.yml  Local multi-service orchestration
  .env.example        Root environment template
```

## Quick Start (Docker)

### 1. Create env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure required values in `.env`

At minimum set:
- `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` (replace `change-me`)
- One provider OAuth set (or both):
  - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
  - `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID`, `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SOUNDCLOUD_REDIRECT_URI`

Optional but common:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`)
- `FRONTEND_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`)

### 3. Start the stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open the apps

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- Health: http://localhost:8000/health

## Local Development (without full Docker stack)

### Option A: Run DB in Docker, run API + frontend locally

Start PostgreSQL only:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

Run API:

```bash
cd api
python -m venv .venv
# Linux/macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell
# .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
python main.py
```

Run frontend in another shell:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

If needed, create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy to Railway

### Architecture

- `postgres`: Railway PostgreSQL service
- `api`: public FastAPI service (root directory: `api`, config: `api/railway.toml`)
- `frontend`: public Next.js service (root directory: `frontend`, config: `frontend/railway.toml`)

### Release-only deployment policy

Production deploys are handled by GitHub Actions from published GitHub Releases (non-prerelease).

1. Disable automatic deploys from GitHub pushes in Railway for both `api` and `frontend`.
2. Keep Railway connected to the repo for build context, but do not allow push-triggered deploys.
3. Deploy production by publishing a GitHub Release.

Required GitHub repository secrets for release deploys:

- `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
- `RAILWAY_API_PROJECT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_API_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_API_SERVICE_ID`
- `RAILWAY_FRONTEND_PROJECT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_FRONTEND_ENVIRONMENT_ID`
- `RAILWAY_FRONTEND_SERVICE_ID`

If API and frontend share the same Railway project/environment, set both API and frontend project/environment secrets to the same values.

### 1. Create services

1. Create a Railway project.
2. Add `Postgres` from Railway templates.
3. Add `api` service from this repo with root directory `api`.
4. Add `frontend` service from this repo with root directory `frontend`.
   - Do not prefix these with `/` in Railway. Use `api` and `frontend`, not `/api` or `/frontend`.

### 2. Configure API variables

Set these in Railway for the `api` service:

- `DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
- `AUTH_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-value>`
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=True`
- `AUTH_COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax` (or `none` for true cross-site deployments)
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://<frontend-domain>.up.railway.app`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://<frontend-domain>.up.railway.app"]`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<spotify-client-id>`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<spotify-client-secret>`
- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://<api-domain>.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/callback/spotify`
- `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_ID=<soundcloud-client-id>`
- `SOUNDCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET=<soundcloud-client-secret>`
- `SOUNDCLOUD_REDIRECT_URI=https://<api-domain>.up.railway.app/api/v1/auth/callback/soundcloud`
- `USER_FILES_DIR=/app/user_files`
- `RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0`

### 3. Configure frontend variables

Set these in Railway for the `frontend` service:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<api-domain>.up.railway.app`

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is required at build time in production image builds.

### 4. Attach persistent volume for avatars

Attach a volume to the `api` service and mount it at:

- `/app/user_files`

This keeps uploaded avatar files across deploys.

### 5. Deploy sequence

1. Deploy `api` and generate its public domain.
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `frontend` to the API domain.
3. Deploy `frontend` and generate its public domain.
4. Update API `FRONTEND_URL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with the frontend domain and redeploy `api`.
5. In Spotify developer settings, set callback URL to:
   - `<url>/api/v1/auth/callback/spotify`
5. In SoundCloud developer settings, set callback URL to:
   - `<url>/api/v1/auth/callback/soundcloud`
6. Ensure `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` and `SOUNDCLOUD_REDIRECT_URI` match exactly, then redeploy `api`.
7. After bootstrap, use GitHub Releases for production deploys:
   - Publish a non-prerelease GitHub Release.
   - GitHub Actions runs quality checks, then deploys both Railway services.

### 6. Smoke test checklist

- API health: `GET /health` returns healthy.
- Frontend loads and can fetch authenticated user state.
- Spotify/SoundCloud login redirects back to app and sets auth cookie.
- Playlist listing/details load.
- Suggest/add/vote flows work.
- Upload avatar, redeploy API, verify avatar still exists.

## Migrations

From `api/`:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe_change"
alembic upgrade head
alembic history
```

## Quality Checks

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Backend:

```bash
cd api
python -m ruff check main.py app tests
python -m black --check main.py app tests
pytest -q
```

Docker test profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile test up --build api_tests
```

## Core API Route Groups

- `/api/v1/auth/*` - OAuth login/callback/logout
- `/api/v1/users/*` - current user profile, settings, avatar
- `/api/v1/playlists/*` - provider playlist listing/creation
- `/api/v1/votuna/*` - Votuna playlists, settings, suggestions, votes, members, invites, management transfer endpoints

## Notes

- Root `.env` is used by both Docker Compose and backend settings loading.
- In local development, ensure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes your frontend host.
- Spotify and SoundCloud are active providers today; Apple Music and TIDAL are planned.
